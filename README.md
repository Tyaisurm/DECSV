# DECSV_project - LERT Tool

This application is made as a part of SLIPPS project, meaning that it will be used by teachers/professors of medical
students, in order to review data from SLIPPS surveys.

You can import csv-files into a project inside the application, which allows you to:
- censor individual words out of the text
- tag individual answers/events with keywords (from pre-built lists)
- export files marked "done" into new csv files

You can also add notes while editing. These are saved inside each project, and are also exported when you export anything.

## INSTALLATATION:
- download installer (pick latest from "releases", Windows ONLY at the moment!!!)
- run installer
