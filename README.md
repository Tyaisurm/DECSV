# DECSV Project - SLIPPS Teacher Tool

This application is made as a part of SLIPPS project, meaning that it will be used by teachers/professors of medical
students, in order to review data from SLIPPS survey tools. NOTICE! Only specific tools with specific contents are supported!

You can import csv-files into a project inside the application, which allows you to:
- Censor individual words out of the text
- Tag individual answers/events with keywords (from pre-built lists)
- Export files marked "done" into new csv files, which are then sent to Virtual Learning Center (needs separate account)

You can also add notes while editing. These are saved inside each project, and are also exported when you export anything.
