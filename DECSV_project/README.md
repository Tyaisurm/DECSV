# DECSV_project

This project is about making a CSV file editor, that
allows its users to open CSV files in it, anonymize personal
data in it, tag keywords from the document or from premade
list, and then save the edited text and keywords into new CSV file.

The program in this project is made based on Electron framework. This
allows the program to be built like a web application, and it also makes
it possible to easily port the program to different platforms
(Linux, Mac, Windows), thanks to the cross platform support of the
Electron framework.
